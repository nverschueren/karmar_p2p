#We refer to these hopf points as the left and right respectively.
# We can get a numerical approximation of the homoclinic orbit in the comoving frame (corresponding to a travelling wave in the PDE) by doing continuation on 2 parameters of the Hopf Bifurcation point (HB), being one of the parameters the PERIOD. The natural choice for the second parameter are 'p' or 's'. When the period is "high enough", we are close to the homoclinic orbit. In practice this means that the different solutions seem to converge to a limit orbit, the homoclinic one. Notice that the discretisation might need some improvement in some cases.

#Interestingly, the continuation in p shows a nontrivial increase in the period. COntinuation in s seems more robust, we'll use a large period lefts as our initial guess for homcont.
